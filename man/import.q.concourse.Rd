\title{Q methodology: import concourse of Q items}
\description{
  Imports full set of items (concourse) from a directory of .TEX files, including possible translations.
}
\usage{
  import.q.concourse(q.concourse.dir, languages=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{q.concourse.dir}{
    A directory of individual .TEX files named as meaningful item short handles (e.g. \code{happy-feeling.tex}).
    If \code{languages} are specified, a directory with folders per language, with all full Q items as individual .TEX files in each language folder, with files named as the \emph{same} meaningful item short handle (e.g. \code{happy-feeling.tex}) across all languages.

    Directories end with a trailing slash, such as \code{study/q-sample/q-concourse/}.
   }
  \item{languages}{
  	a character vector of languages, same as folders below \code{q.concourse.dir}.
  	If your concourse is monolingual, leave empty, defaults to \code{NULL}.
  }
}
\details{
	Q studies are conducted by asking participants (or a p-set) to rank order a \emph{sample} (or q-set) of items, drawn from a universe (or concourse) of items, based on some sampling strategy.
	A concourse is, simply put, \emph{the sum of all things people could say about a subject matter}.

	It is helpful to keep the \emph{entire} concourse readily available, so as to draw samples from it.

	For some studies, it is necessary to have the complete items available in several languages.

	This function simply imports all full item wordings and assigns a \emph{meaningful item short handle} based on the file name.
	These handles should be meaningful to the researcher.

	Individual items as .TEX files should include minimal markup, and no trailing whitespace or empty newlines.
	If you do not need any additional formatting, you can just save plain text files (.TXT) with the extension .TEX.
	There is no need to know \href{http://www.latex-project.org}{LaTeX}.

	Throws error if items are not available in all translations.

  Defaults to monolingual variant.

  More details on the files and directory structure expected by this function can be found in the \link{qmethod-package} documentation, and on the package \href{https://github.com/aiorazabala/qmethod/wiki/Data-management}{wiki}.
}
\value{
	Returns character matrix with meaningful item short handles (from file names) as rownames, languages (if applicable) as columns and full wording per language in cells.
